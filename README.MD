# Think Cell 1st Task

## Task Description

You are given the following source code:

```javascript
const sampleInput = [
  {
    key: [1, 4],
    val: "red",
  },
  {
    key: [-2, -1],
    val: "green",
  },
  {
    key: [2, 40],
    val: "blue",
  },
];

function makeQuery(input) {
  return (key) =>
    input.find(function (item) {
      return item.key[0] <= key && key < item.key[1];
    })?.val;
}
```

The array `sampleInput` contains a list of intervals (key) which are mapped to a value (val). The function `makeQuery` takes input of this format and returns a query function. The query function takes a key argument and finds the interval that (right exclusive) contains this key. It then returns the corresponding value for this interval. If no interval is found, the query function returns “undefined”. The function can be used like this:

```javascript
query = makeQuery(sampleInput);
query(3); // returns 'red'
```

Note that `sampleInput` is just example data. You should expect the real input to be much bigger, and it can contain arbitrary data for mapped values. The input is not ordered, and the first interval takes precedence in case of overlaps.

Your task is to rewrite and improve `makeQuery`. The provided query function is very simple and inefficient for large input data. Imagine `makeQuery` to be called once on a given input and preprocess it. Your returned query function should be able to efficiently handle many requests for arbitrary input data. Apart from that, it should give the same results as our query function.
